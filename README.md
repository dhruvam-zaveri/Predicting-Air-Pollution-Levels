# Predicting-Air-Pollution-Levels

Using air samples from different locations in New Delhi five features of air were extracted which can be used to predict the air quality index and combined it with the air quality index given in the newspapers. Provided with this data our job is to design a machine learning model, which when given the features extracted available in the dataset can predict air quality index.

Train:- The train data consists of five feature columns and one target column. All the feature
columns are numeric and target value is also numeric.

Test:- Test data consist all the columns contained by train with the exception of target column
which u have to predict using the model trained on train data.

Used multi feature linear regression.

Please find the attached training and testing data.
